With some friends, we decided to create a thing called "Custom Courses" in a game called vivid/stasis.
Custom Courses takes the core principle of courses (4 musics in a row without retry in between) and adapt it with our own theme-based courses.
You don't have the obligation to use a stamina bar since we can't keep track of the stamina you have left after one song.

We actually have 14 main courses and 5 "legacy" courses (courses that were meant to be deleted) were you can enter your scores and see your improvement over time !
Each courses are composed of 5 difficulties : EXPOSITION, TWIST, INTERLUDE, CLIMAX, APOTHEOSIS.
They go from the easier version of each song to more difficult version by keeping the overall balanced to match some levelcap (or at least we tried)

At first, we were just keeping highscores on a sheet but we didn't have a really great way of calculating the total score and lacked a way to keep older scores properly.
And so come the purpose of this app. To help keeping scores locally (at the moment) and having an easy way to visualize Courses, scores and older scores.

It was supposed to be private but it's funny to leave it public (not that it was easier to leave it public at all)

# Have fun playing these courses and using this app !
