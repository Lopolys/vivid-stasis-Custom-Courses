Regarding courses.json and coursesLegacy.json :

These files contain every custom courses we made.
If you delete it, you'll lose your best score data for each difficulty and each courses.

You cannot add your own courses if you want at the moment.
We prefer these files to stay as it is.

We'll consider adding a "Course Creator" in the future if many are asking (especially for something like "favorites course" and stuff like that)

Regarding scores.json :

If you delete this file, you'll have a new one once you launch the app with the "Sample Course" already inside and also lose all your saved scores.
If you want to tinker it, please be aware that you NEED to keep the "[" at the start and "]" at the end of the file or else Course History won't work at all

Regarding userprefs.json :

This file contains your last selected theme and font.
If you delete it, it will just be recreated with default font and theme.

Regarding musics.json :

This file contains every music informations that are actually available in-game.
We try to keep it up to date as much as possible while the game isn't completely finished in it's development.
PLEASE DO NOT DELETE OR MODIFY THIS FILE (it's also why you do not have direct access to it)

Note : We are not currently aware of an editor for custom musics to play in-game.
If one exists, we'll consider adding a "Music Creator" section to let you add your musics to the app.
