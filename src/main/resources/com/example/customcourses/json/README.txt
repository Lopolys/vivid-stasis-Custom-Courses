Regarding the courses.json files :

These files contain every custom courses we made.
If you delete it, you'll lose your best score data for each difficulty and each courses.

You cannot add your own courses if you want at the moment.
We prefer these files to stay as it is.

We'll consider adding a "Course Creator" in the future if many are asking (especially for something like "favorites course" and stuff like that, but they will never be "official" custom courses")

Regarding scores.json :

If you delete this file, you'll have a new one once you launch the app with the "Sample Course" already inside and also lose all your saved scores.
If you want to tinker it, please be aware that you NEED to keep the "[" at the start and "]" at the end of the file or else Course History won't work at all.

Regarding userprefs.json :

This file contains your last selected theme, font, title and your username.
If you delete it, it will just be recreated with default theme, font, title and username.

Regarding titles.json :

This file contains the list of all your currently unlocked titles through their ids.
If you delete it, you will lose all your currently unlocked titles and it will be recreated with only the initial title in it.
Trying to add a custom title id in it may cause trouble in the app, so please don't do that.

Regarding musics.json :

At the moment, you should not have access to this file here. It contains every music information that are actually available in-game.
We try to keep it up to date as much as possible while the game is continuing to update his content.
If you somehow have access to it, do not delete or modify it since it will potentially break the entire app on your side.

Note : We are not currently aware of an editor for custom musics to play in-game.
If one exists, we'll consider adding a "Music Creator" section in the future to let you add your musics to the app, which could also be used in a potential "Course Creator".
