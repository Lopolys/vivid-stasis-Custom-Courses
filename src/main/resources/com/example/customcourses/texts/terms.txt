I don't have a real idea of what to say here at the moment so I'll just give some informations that I feel could prove to be usefull in the future

# The original idea of Custom Courses was designed by Akkala on July 21st 2024.
If someone else got the same idea before, we didn't know they did and so didn't use them as a reference.

# The game is developped by Hajimeli and I don't have any connection to them.
Every assets I use are from the wiki, in-game sreenshots or other screenshots I did and then removing their background manually.

Below is the link directing to the game since I do not own any right toward it and don't really want to have problems if I don't refer to it properly :
-#- https://store.steampowered.com/app/2093940/vividstasis/

You can use this code how you want even if I prefer it to stay as it is since it is just a small thing between friends.
-#- I don't plan on making it a huge thing for now so yeah. Maybe later who knows ?

If there is something missing here I'll update it when I find what is missing but that's all I can think of right now
